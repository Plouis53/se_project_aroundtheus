Project Description and Tech Functionality

This project is a website containing a profile for Jacques Cousteau and different cards containing names and images off different areas in the U.S. This project shows how to create an HTML file and CSS files to create a website that works at resolutions as high at 1280px (desktop) and as small as 320px (mobile). The site includes a header, main content, and footer. All of the buttons on the site have interactive hovers. The site displays different cards using a grid layout

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.
